1. Does preprocessing affect the model’s results? Why?
- Yes, preprocessing really makes a difference. When you scale features like Price and Landsize with something like Standard Scaler, 
it stops the bigger numbers from overpowering everything else during clustering. 
Also, filling in missing data with SimpleImputer helps keep the dataset whole, 
so the model doesn’t lose any important info or mess up the distance calculations. 
Without doing this, the clusters could end up biased or just plain wrong because some features would dominate and missing data would cause problems.


2. What do you conclude from the model’s results?
- The model showed that there are basically four different groups in the Melbourne housing market, which we figured out using the 
elbow method. It did a good job separating properties based on things like price, size, and location. So, you can see the market 
isn’t all the same, it’s made up of different types of homes, which is useful if you want to understand or target specific segments.
